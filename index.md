## Introduction

This application is a personal research and analytics tool used to analyze publicly available software reviews.

The App retrieves review information from G2 through its official API for temporary analysis only.

## Data We Access

The App may retrieve publicly available information from G2, including:

* Software product names
* Ratings
* Review text
* Review metadata (such as date or category)

The App does **not attempt to identify reviewers** and does not combine the data with other datasets to profile individuals.

## Processing and Storage

The App does **not permanently store personal data**.

All retrieved information is processed temporarily in memory and discarded after the analysis session ends.
No databases or persistent storage retain G2 review content.

## Third-Party Processing (AI Analysis)

For the purpose of text analysis and summarization, review content may be transmitted to an external AI processing provider (OpenAI).

The data is:

* transmitted only for processing
* not used to identify individuals
* not resold
* not retained by the App after processing

The App does not use the data to train its own machine learning models.

## Purpose of Processing

The data is used exclusively for:

* personal research
* aggregated analytics
* identifying software usability patterns

The App does not use the data for advertising, marketing, or contacting individuals.

## Data Sharing

Aside from temporary processing by the AI provider described above, the App does not share retrieved data with third parties.

## Third-Party Source

This application accesses publicly available review data provided by G2.
G2 remains the original source and owner of the content.

## User Rights

Since the App does not store personal data, there is no personal data maintained by the App to access, modify, export, or delete.
